# ðŸ“¬ Message Templates

The `MessageTemplates` service provides friendly, contextual messages related to user subscription events. These messages can be used in notifications, banners, or emails to inform users about their subscription status.

> ðŸ§  Use them in **notifications**, **emails**, **dashboards**, or **banners** to guide users through trials, renewals, grace periods, or payment issues.

## How it works
Use the static `getMessage()` method to automatically generate the appropriate message based on:

- Status: `trial`, `renewal`, `grace_period`, or `failed_payment`

- Days left before/after a key event

- The user instance
```php
use Koverae\KoveraeBilling\Services\Billing\MessageTemplates;

$message = MessageTemplates::getMessage('trial', 2, $user);
```
